# Calculation of the corrected cosmological constant vacuum energy density

# Typical quantum field theory estimated vacuum energy density upper bound
rho_QFT = 1e113  # J/m^3

# Fixed vacuum phase compression ratio
Phi_vacuum_compression = 1e-120

# Corrected vacuum energy density
rho_Lambda = rho_QFT * Phi_vacuum_compression
