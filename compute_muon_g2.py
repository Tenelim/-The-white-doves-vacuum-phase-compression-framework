# Corrected calculation of the muon gâ€“2 anomaly using fixed vacuum field bias correction ratio

# Theoretical QED prediction for muon g-factor
g_QED = 2.0023318418

# Fixed proposed vacuum field bias correction factor
delta_muon_field_bias = 2.541e-9

# Corrected muon g-factor
g_mu = g_QED * (1 + delta_muon_field_bias)
